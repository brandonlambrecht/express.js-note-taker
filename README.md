  ## Description
  
  The express.js note taker repository is an application deployed through Heroku that will allow the user to add notes with a title and task which will be saved in a list to view at anytime. The motivation behind the note taker repository is to show case how express.js can be utilized to create a note taking application by requiring and importing different paths. The application also demonstrates a full-stack approach to web development by connecting the front-end to the back-end.
